		<h1>BIOGRAPHY</h1>
		<p> Ronaldo de Assis Moreira, commonly known as Ronaldinho or Ronaldinho Gaúcho, 
		is a Brazilian former professional footballer and ambassador for Spanish club Barcelona. 
		He played mostly as an attacking midfielder, but was also deployed as a forward or a winger. 
		He played the bulk of his career at European clubs Paris Saint-Germain, FC Barcelona and Milan as well as playing for the Brazilian national team. 
		Often considered one of the best players of his generation and regarded by many as one of the greatest of all time, 
		Ronaldinho won two FIFA World Player of the Year awards and a Ballon d'Or. 
		He was renowned for his technical skills and creativity; due to his agility, pace and dribbling ability, 
		as well as his use of tricks, overhead kicks, no-look passes and accuracy from free-kicks.
		</p>
		<p> Ronaldinho made his senior debut for Grêmio, in 1998. 
		At age 20, he moved to Paris Saint-Germain in France before signing for FC Barcelona in 2003. 
		In his second season with Barcelona, he won his first FIFA World Player of the Year Award, as FC Barcelona won La Liga. 
		The season that followed is considered one of the best in his career as he was instrumental in Barcelona winning the UEFA Champions League, 
		their first in fourteen years, as well as another La Liga title, giving Ronaldinho his first career double. 
		After scoring two spectacular solo goals in El Clásico, Ronaldinho became the second FC Barcelona player, 
		after Diego Armando Maradona in 1983, to receive a standing ovation from Real Madrid fans at the Santiago Bernabéu. 
		Ronaldinho also received his second FIFA World Player of the Year award, as well as the Ballon d'Or.
		</p>
		<p> Following a second-place La Liga finish to rivals Real Madrid in the 2006-07 season and an injury plagued 2007-08 season, 
		Ronaldinho departed FC Barcelona to join Milan. 
		He then returned to Brazil to play for Flamengo in 2011 and Atlético Mineiro a year later, 
		before moving to Mexico to play for Querétaro and then back to Brazil to play for Fluminense in 2015. 
		Throughout his playing career, Ronaldinho accumulated numerous other individual honours. 
		He was named in the UEFA Team of the Year and the FIFA World XI three times, 
		honoured as the UEFA Club Footballer of the Year in 2006 and was named in the FIFA 100, 
		a list of the world's greatest living players compiled by Pelé.
		</p>
		<p> At international level, Ronaldinho played 97 matches for the Brazil national team, 
		scoring 33 goals and representing his country in two FIFA World Cups. 
		He was an integral part of the 2002 FIFA World Cup Korea/Japan (2002)-winning team in Korea and Japan, 
		starring alongside Ronaldo and Rivaldo in an attacking trio, scoring two goals, 
		including a free-kick from 40 yards out against England, registering two assists and being named in the FIFA World Cup All-Star Team. 
		As captain, he led Brazil to their second Confederations Cup title in 2005 and was named Man of the Match in a 4-1 victory over archrivals Argentina in the final. 
		Ronaldinho scored three goals in the tournament, taking his total to nine, making him the competition's joint all-time leading goalscorer.
		</p>
		<p> Following a second-place La Liga finish to rivals Real Madrid in the 2006-07 season and an injury plagued 2007-08 season, 
				Ronaldinho departed FC Barcelona to join Milan. 
				He then returned to Brazil to play for Flamengo in 2011 and Atlético Mineiro a year later, 
				before moving to Mexico to play for Querétaro and then back to Brazil to play for Fluminense in 2015. 
				Throughout his playing career, Ronaldinho accumulated numerous other individual honours. 
				He was named in the UEFA Team of the Year and the FIFA World XI three times, 
				honoured as the UEFA Club Footballer of the Year in 2006 and was named in the FIFA 100, 
				a list of the world's greatest living players compiled by Pelé.
				</p>
				<p> At international level, Ronaldinho participated in his first World Cup in 2002, as part of a formidable offensive unit with Ronaldo and Rivaldo, dubbed the "Three Rs", who were also on the 1999 Copa América winning squad.
				The World Cup was held in Korea and Japan, and Ronaldinho appeared in five matches during the tournament and scored two goals, as well as contributing several important assists. 
				His first goal came in the group stage match against China PR, which Brazil won 4–0.
				The most memorable match in Ronaldinho's World Cup career took place in the quarter-final against England on 21 June.
				With Brazil trailing after Michael Owen's 23-minute strike, Ronaldinho turned the game around. 
				Having received the ball inside his own half, Ronaldinho ran at the England defence and wrong footed star defender Ashley Cole with a trademark step over before passing the ball to Rivaldo on the edge of the penalty area to score the equalising goal just before half-time.
				Then, in the 50th minute, Ronaldinho took a free-kick from 40 yards out which curled into the top left corner of the net, completely surprising England's goalkeeper David Seaman, giving Brazil a 2–1 lead.
				Seven minutes later, however, he was controversially sent-off for a foul on England's defender Danny Mills. 
				Ronaldinho was suspended for the semi-final, but returned to Brazil's starting lineup for the 2–0 victory over Germany in the final as Brazil won its record fifth World Cup title.
				</p>
				<p>On 16 January 2018, Ronaldinho confirmed his retirement from football through his brother/agent: "He has stopped, it is ended.
				Let's do something pretty big and nice after the Russia World Cup, probably in August.
				Such a celebration was supposed to take place three years after his last appearance for Fluminense, but has not been materialized.
				He retired as one of just seven players to have won the FIFA World Cup, the UEFA Champions League and the Ballon d'Or.
				Ronaldinho appeared at the closing ceremony of the 2018 FIFA World Cup at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow on 15 July, performing a few bars of the Russian folk song "Kalinka" (sung by opera singer Aida Garifullina) on an African drum.
